   - Copy the environment template to create your `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp template.env .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and edit the following values:
     - `CONFIG_PATH`: Path to the repository where all configuration folders will be stored
     - `ZIGBEE_CHANNEL`: Zigbee channel number
   - Example:
     ```
     CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/home-assistant-web3-build
     ZIGBEE_CHANNEL=15
     ```
